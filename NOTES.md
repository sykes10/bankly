# Personal notes about the project

## Design

I know there's some style where I didn't follow the figma 100% but I tried to maxize the style and the variables I already had to avoid having different values all over the place.

There were some figma designs where I didn't know if it was designed like that in purpose or not but this could be a good point for discussion. I usually like to get design involved to make sure the styles are following a framework or values as much a possible when the feature allows it.
